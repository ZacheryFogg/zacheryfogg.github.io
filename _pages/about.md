My research interests lie at the intersection of NLP and ML with the goal of creating language models (LMs)
that can effectively understand and communicate with humans in natural language. The current topics
that I am most drawn to are the following: (1) Memory Augmentation and External Knowledge Retrieval
– I believe that augmenting LMs with updateable long-term memory (parametric or non-parametric) or external
knowledge retrieval will be essential in continuing to improve their abilities by decoupling the scaling of knowledge
that they have access to from their training data and model size, as well as improving their interpretability and
factuality. (2) Multimodal Learning – I think that models that have the ability to learn from and interpret
multiple modalities of data will be able to build much richer representations of language than models that rely on
textual data alone. (3) Representation Learning – Improving the mechanisms available to LMs for automatically
learning semantically and contextually aware representations (whether those representations be of words, phrases, or
even concepts) will be crucial in bolstering their understanding of natural language.
